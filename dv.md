## Distribution of Income Among People with Different Educational Attainment

#### Description
This data visualization is created based on the dataset summarize trends in adult annual income between 1990 and 2019 based on their educational attainment : some high school & below, high school, college incomplete, associate degree, average, bachelor, master, doctor, professional. This visualization is based on the data from sample surveys of the noninstitutionalized population since the 1990s, which excludes persons living in institutions (e.g., prisons ,nursing facilities and military barracks).
